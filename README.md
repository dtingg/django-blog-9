Lesson 08 Assignment: Django Addons & Security  

I added two enhancements:  
<h3>Django All-Auth</h3>  

* Users can login with their Facebook credentials (or sign up for a new account).  

* I also added Like and Share buttons, but they won't work while the site is in development.  

<h3>Django ModelForm</h3>  

* I created a form for users to enter a new blog post.  

* I also added a button for this feature on the homepage.
